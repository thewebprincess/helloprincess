I think that for every person who downloads and installs WordPress who is remotely interested in how plugins work and how to edit and tweak them to make them do what you will, Hello Dolly is our first playground.

I've loved the song Hello Dolly, and jazz music longer than Matt who wrote the plugin. But I've loved the Princess Bride longer... so when I was looking for some entertainment one afternoon I forked Dolly and made Hello Princess... 

Seems fitting for a Web Princess to have a Princessy plugin... especially as I really am more likely to have Bose headphones on my noggin than a tiara...

Enjoy
